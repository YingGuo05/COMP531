      <p>Hi, my friends! I'm Ying Guo! I come from China. This photo was taken in Beijing, China. Friends and I went to taste new
        product in Diary Queen. The ice cream was great with chocolate and cookies.</p>
      <p> I love cooking and working out in the gym. Doing exercise makes me relaxed and enjoying tasty food makes me happy.
